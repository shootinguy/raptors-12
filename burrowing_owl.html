            <p>Only slightly larger than an American Robin, the small burrowing owl is unlike most other owls found in open, dry areas of North and South America. They have long featherless legs, live on the ground in the empty burrows of ground 
                squirrels and other small mammals, and are diurnal (awake during the daytime) not nocturnal (awake at night) like other owls. Unlike most owls, burrowing owls migrate south for the winter, and while they are still amazing raptors 
                (hunting birds), they will sometimes supplement their diet of mice and other small animals with seeds and small plants.</p>
            <p>The burrowing owl is at risk at varying levels and is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The main reason for their danger is from losing of their prairie habitat and humans trying to 
                control the rodent population.</p>
